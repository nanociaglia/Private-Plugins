# EndRoundStopper
Useful for JB servers. The round won't finish if the time reachs the 00:00. It'll finish only if any of the two teams are killed.
This was created because if you want to do other stuff when the time reachs 00:00, the round won't finish allowing you to do whatever you want to do (as i said, until any of the two teams are eliminated)

# !noblock / !block
Allow CTs to activate/deactivate noblock on the server (also 1 cvar to allow only wardens to use this command)
